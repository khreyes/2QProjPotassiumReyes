        <p>The Olympic was restored for civilian service in August of 1919. During this restoration, a dent identified to have been caused by 
            a faulty German torpedo that had failed to detonate was discovered. It also carried a lot of Canadian Troops from Europe to Canada.
            For the next 15 years, the RMS Olympic would enjoy the longest uninterrupted peacetime operations. The rest of the Olympicâ€™s service 
            would deem successful but at that point, it was really getting old. In 1934, The Olympic collided with a lightship due to heavy fog and 
            difficult miscommunication. </p>
        <br>
        <p> It was retired from service in 1935, and lasted longer than other two ships in class, which both sank. Its final voyage was 
            on April 5th 1935. It was scrapped between 1935 and 1937. During her operations, it had completed 257 round trips across the 
            Atlantic. Watch the video below to see the whole life of the RMS Olympic animated. </p>

        <p> The RMS Olympic was the lead ship and the namesake of the Olympic class ocean liners. RMS stands for Royal Mail Steamer
            and it means that the ship was tasked to deliver mail from the United Kingdom to the United States and vice-versa. 
            It was ordered in 1907 and was first laid down on December 16th 1908. It was in service for both commercial and naval 
            use from 1911 to 1935. It was completed on October 20th 1911, and was the largest ship in the world, with a tonnage of 
            45,324 GRT, or Gross Registered Tons. It was 261 meters long and as much as 28 meters on its widest. </p>

        <h2> Design and Construction </h2>

        <p id="design"> The RMS Olympic, like the rest of the Olympic class liners, were constructed in Belfast, by a ship building company, Harland and Wolff.
            It was designed and proposed as the most luxurious and the largest of ships, and they did succeed in that. It was about 1.5 times bigger 
            than the rival Cunard Line's RMS Mauretania but was slower. It had a top speed of 21 knots, which was less than the Mauretania's operating
            speed because it was simply too expensive to compete. One of RMS Olympic's funnels was actually not functional but was there for aesthetics.
            It had a total of nine decks, seven of which were open to the passengers, with the rest used for cargo and of course, the engines. It had the
            capacity to carry more than 60 lifeboats but it only carried 24 prior to the sinking of the Titanic,,which still met regulations for that time.
            For safety, it had a double keel, which means the bottom part of the ship was thicker. It also had 16 watertight compartments, and it's designed 
            to stay afloat even when 4 compartments are breached.

        <p> Its features were very similar to Titanic and were designed as a luxury ship. For the first class passengers, it had a restaurant, private bathrooms 
            massive staterooms and some with private promenades, a grand staircase, pool, gymnasium, and a cafe. For the Second Class, it had a library, their own 
            staircase, and their own promenades. Compared to other ships, the Third Class was actually much more comfortable. It also had a smoking room, common areas, 
            and dining saloons for each class. </p>

        <p> The Olympic class ocean liners were a trio of passenger ships under the shipping company, White Star Line.
            They were the RMS Olympic, RMS Titanic, and the HMHS Britannic and were designed as symbols of Great Britain
            in the transatlantic ocean travel. Out of the three, only one ship would last more than a year in service.  </p>

        <h2> Design </h2>
        <hr>
        <img class=imgdesign src=../images/page1-design.png> The Olympic class ships were very similar to eachother, almost appearing as triplets when they were designed. 
            The ships were designed with size and luxury in mind. When each ship was completed, it was considered as the biggest
            ship in the world, all of which around 45,000 to 48,000 Gross Registered Tons. Before the Titanic disaster, the Olympic 
            and Titanic were only carrying a total 20 lifeboats, but both of which had the capacity to have more than 60. They each 
            featured a grand staircase, outdoor promenade decks, pools, and other luxuries for the three classes to enjoy.

        <h2> Quick History </h2>
        <hr>
        <img class=imghistory src=../images/page1-history.jpg> The origins of the Olympic class started with a competition between German adn British shipping lines. The RMS Olympic was built 
            and completed by 1911, with the Titanic being finished a year later. HMHS Britannic was supposed to be in passenger service but, 
            the British Royal Navy acquired it for the war, along with the Olympic, once it was finished. As we all know, Titanic sank on her maiden voyage on April 14, 1912. 
            Britannic also sunk after hitting a mine off the coast of Galipoli, on November 21, 1916.

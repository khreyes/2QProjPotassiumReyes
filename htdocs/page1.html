        <h1> The RMS Olympic </h1>
        <hr>
        <img id=p1introimg src=../images/page1-intro.jpg> </img>
        <p> The RMS Olympic was the lead ship and the namesake of the Olympic class ocean liners. It was ordered in 1907 and was 
            first laid down on December 16th 1908. It was in service for both commercial and naval use from 1911 to 1935. It was 
            completed on October 20th 1911, and was the largest ship in the world, with a tonnage of 45,324 GRT. It was 261m long 
            and as much as 28m wide. </p>

        <p> Its features were very similar to Titanic, designed as a luxury ship. It had a restaurant, private bathrooms and 
            luxurious cabins for first class passengers, a grand staircase, pool, gymnasium, and cafe. Third class was still more 
            comfortable compared to other ships. It also had a smoking room, common areas, and multiple dining rooms. </p>

        <h2> Pre-War History </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> The RMS Olympic first set sail from Southampton on its maiden voyage on June 14th 1911 and a week later, it arrived 
            in New York after a pretty uneventful maiden voyage as it did not break any speed records. </p>
        <br>
        <p>On September 20th 1911, as she was departing and executing a difficult turn, a British Navy Ship, HMS Hawke was sucked into 
        the starboard side of the Olympic, colliding with it and causing a gash that flooded two of the watertight compartments. 
        Surprisingly, no one was injured and neither of the ships sank. The RMS Olympic had to go back to port where it had to undergo 
        repairs for 6 weeks due to the incident.</p>
        <br>
        <p> On April 14th 1912, the Olympic was involved in the sinking of its sister ship, the RMS Titanic. Although the Titanic was 
            able to reach the Olympic through radio, it was simply too far away to be of any help. After the disaster, the Olympic was 
            fitted with more lifeboats and was refitted to be more safe. </p>

        <h2> Significance during World War 1</h2>
        <hr>
        <img id=p1prewar src=../images/page1-history.jpg> </img>
        <p> In 1914, the RMS Olympic originally remained as a commercial ocean-liner, usually bringing trapped Americans from Europe back
             to North America. She was repainted gray and all lights were either turned off or covered. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In May 1914, the Olympic was requisitioned by the British Navy. It was refitted to be armed with guns and painted with a dazzle 
            design to make targeting it harder. From September 1915, it was used as a troopship and renamed to HMT Olympic, carrying soldiers 
            to and from war.</p>
        <br>
        <p> On May 12th 1918, The RMS Olympic spotted a German submarine and turned to ram the submarine, causing it to sink. The Olympic 
            continued on its course a bit damaged but it stayed watertight. It survived the war, carrying more than 200 thousand troops, and 
            was nicknamed the “Old Reliable”.

        <h2> Post-War Service and Retirement </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Olympic was restored for civilian service in August of 1919. During this restoration, a dent identified to have been caused by 
            a faulty German torpedo that had failed to detonate was discovered.  For the next 15 years, the RMS Olympic would enjoy the longest 
            uninterrupted peacetime operations. The rest of the Olympic’s service would deem successful but at that point, it was really 
            getting old. In 1934, The Olympic collided with a lightship due to heavy fog and difficult miscommunication. </p>
        <br>
        <p> It was retired from service in 1935, and lasted longer than other two ships in class, which both sank. Its final voyage was 
            on April 5th 1935. It was scrapped between 1935 and 1937. During her operations, it had completed 257 round trips across the 
            Atlantic. </p>

        <p> The RMS Olympic first set sail from Southampton on its maiden voyage on June 14th 1911 and a week later, it arrived 
            in New York after a pretty uneventful maiden voyage as it did not break any speed records. </p>
        <p>On September 20th 1911, as she was departing and executing a difficult turn, a British Navy Ship, HMS Hawke was sucked into 
        the starboard side of the Olympic, colliding with it and causing a gash that flooded two of the watertight compartments. 
        Surprisingly, no one was injured and neither of the ships sank. The RMS Olympic had to go back to port where it had to undergo 
        repairs for 6 weeks due to the incident.</p>
        <p> On April 14th 1912, the Olympic was involved in the sinking of its sister ship, the RMS Titanic. Although the Titanic was 
            able to reach the Olympic through radio, it was simply too far away to be of any help. After the disaster, the Olympic was 
            fitted with more lifeboats and was refitted to be much safer. </p>

        <p> In 1914, when Great Britain declared war, the RMS Olympic originally remained as a commercial ocean-liner, usually bringing trapped 
            Americans from Europe back to North America. She was repainted gray and all lights were either turned off or covered. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In May 1914, the Olympic was requisitioned by the British Navy. It was refitted to be armed with guns and painted with a dazzle 
            design to make targeting it harder. From September 1915, it was used as a troopship and renamed to HMT Olympic, carrying soldiers 
            to and from war.</p>
        <br>
        <p> On May 12th 1918, The RMS Olympic spotted a German submarine and turned to ram the submarine, causing it to sink. The Olympic 
            continued on its course a bit damaged but it stayed watertight. It survived the war, carrying more than 200 thousand troops, and 
            was nicknamed the “Old Reliable”.

        <p>The website will be about the RMS Olympic, the lead of a trio of ships built in the 1900s. 
        In this website, it will showcase its innovations, history, 
        and a lot of interesting things about it. The RMS Olympic's history will be discussed in three pages. The pages will be
        discussing the design, history, and cool facts you might've not known. Everyone knows about the 
        Titanic, but its sister ship, the Olympic, is just as interesting!  </p>

       <h2> About the Olympic Class </h2>
    <hr>
        <img id=index-wsl src=images/wsl_logo.png> 
       <p> The Olympic class of ocean liners were a trio of ships designed and built for the White Star Line in the early 1900s.  
           The idea of the Olympic class was first conceived by the chairman of the White Star Line, Bruce Ismay,
           after the completion of two ships from a rival company, the Cunard Line. Cunard Line ships were well-known because of 
           their focus on speed. The White Star Line were eager to catch up to them, but it was simply too expensive for them 
           to try and outspeed the Cunard liners so they prioritized size and luxury above all, and designed a trio of ships which
           would become the largest and most luxurious in the world at their time. However, only the RMS Olympic would survive more than 
           a year.
